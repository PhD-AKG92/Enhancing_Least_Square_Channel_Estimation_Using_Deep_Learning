MatLab functions:
-----------------------
1) Main_Simulation: use it to generate datasets.

2) Channel_functions: includes different channel models definitions.

3) Estimation_functions: includes LS, MMSE, Rh_calculation, W_MMSE_calculation functions.

4) Process_Training_Data: Convert generated datasets from complex domain to real domain.

5) DNN_Results_Processing: use it to process the DNN results, just you need to choose which DNN model you want to show by setting the DNN_index variable.
   Forexample if DNN_index = 30, then the results for the tranied DNN model on SNR = 30dB will be shown.
