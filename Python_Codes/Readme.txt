LS_DNN_Training: this file is used to train the LS_DNN model according to a specific SNR value, after that the trained LS_DNN is saved to be used later in the testing phase. 
----------------
LS_DNN_Testing: this file is used to test the trained LS_DNN model perfromance on the whole datasets for all the whole SNR range.
